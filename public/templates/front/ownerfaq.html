          <h5>Can I turn down a potential renter?</h5>
          <div class="cke-faq">Absolutely! As an owner you control every aspect of your vehicle and its use on the platform. Owners control dates of availability, as well as types of rentals and pricing. If you are unable to commit to a rental request, simply choose to decline the request. When you do receive a request from a renter, you will also be able to view the renter’s profile prior to accepting or declining the request. All owners have final say in who rents their cars.

          <div class="cke-faq"><p>Should there be a mechanical issue with the vehicle during a rental, Corsa provides the industry's&nbsp;most comprehensive roadside service on all vehicles during the rental period. This roadside assistance is included with every rental at no cost to the owner or renter. &nbsp;</p>

          <h5>Where do I exchange my car with the renter?</h5>
          <div class="cke-faq">This decision is completely up to you as the owner. We do suggest that you keep transactions in your geographical area. We recommend to letting the renter come to you, as this keeps matters safer and less complicated. Many owners feel comfortable with an exchange at their home. Some renters may ask to meet at location more convenient for them. If this is the case we suggest large parking lots such as malls and department stores.  We also recommend using a location where you will be able to take the renter for a quick spin to get them acquainted with the vehicle.

          <h5>Can I rent my car out only for Events such as a wedding?</h5>
          <div class="cke-faq"><p>Yes! Many times a renter will request your car for photographs or as a display vehicle. No one, other than yourself, will drive the vehicle. Corsa defines these Non-Driving Rentals as "Events". Owners have the ability to limit rentals solely for "Events".&nbsp;You will be covered by our insurance policy during the entire rental process, including transportation of the vehicle to the location. Renters are required to still go through our vetting process as well as charged the required security deposit to cover any incidentals.</p>

If you find a parking ticket on your car or one is mailed to you, please pay it, and send a copy to us at help@corsa.com and we will reimburse you.&nbsp;(Please note that Corsa is not responsible for late fees added onto unpaid toll notices or parking tickets.) Please remember that we'll need to see the complete date and time of the violation, as well as a copy of the ticket, for full reimbursement!</p>
                 <p>If the ticket is a moving violation, particularly a photo-ticket where the driver is not identified, we will provide (upon request to help@corsa.com) documentation to you to support your contesting of the violation and/or transferring of the violation to the renter. Please note that procedures differ by jurisdiction.</p>
